# AmalgamateJS
A framework that helps simplify bot creation across multiple platforms.

## About this project
The goal of this project is to create an all inclusive bot library for the purpose of multi-platform bots. As it currently stands, creating bots on multiple platforms requires a lot of duplicate code whether in the connection process, message handling, or sending. We look to solve this problem by creating a library to, as a first step, handle these 3 steps. The next step will involve platform specific API calls.
